            <h2>Highlights from the life of Rachel Carson:</h2>
            <ul id="tribute-info">
              <li><strong>May 27, 1907</strong> - Rachel Carson was born on a family farm near Springdale, Pennsylvania, just up the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh.</li>
                <li><strong>1915 to 17</strong> - She began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight and had her first story published at age ten. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature.</li>
                <li><strong>1925</strong> - Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby Parnassus, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-four students.
                Though admitted to graduate standing at Johns Hopkins University in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated magna cum laude in 1929. After a summer course at the Marine Biological Laboratory, she continued her studies in zoology and genetics at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.</li>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression.</li>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> - Her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. </li>
                <li><strong>July 1937</strong>, the Atlantic Monthly accepted a revised version of an essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure.</li> 
                <li><strong>Early 1953</strong>, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore.</li>
                <li><strong>In 1955</strong>, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems, particularly along the Eastern Seaboard. It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.</li>
                <li><strong>Mid-1940s</strong>, Carson became concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the United States federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons.</li>
                <li>Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT.</li>
                <li><strong>By 1959</strong>, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, Fire Ant on Trial; Carson characterized it as "flagrant propaganda" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially dieldrin and heptachlor) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in The Washington Post, that attributed the recent decline in bird populations—in her words, the "silencing of birds"—to pesticide overuse.</li>
                <li>In one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee. The committee issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims.[80] Following the report's release, she also testified before a United States Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>1964</strong> - She died of a heart attack on April 14, in her home in Silver Spring, Maryland.</li>
                <li><em>Carson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world).</em></li>
                <li><strong>Posthumous honors:</strong>
                The Rachel Carson Bridge in Pittsburgh, mid-1999,
                A variety of groups ranging from government institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's life and work since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17¢ Great Americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well.[92] In 1973, Carson was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.</li>
